A valid map data file should contains:

num_rows
num_cols
terrain

An example:

    8
    6
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0


Terrain type specification:

    0: plain
    1: forest (which prevents calvary movement-type from passing or standing on)
    2: water/mountain (only flying movement-type can pass or stand on)
    3: half-barrier (if attacked once, its value becomes 0)
    4: full-barrier (if attacked once, its value becomes 4)
    5: unbreakable-barrier (no unit can pass or stand on)

Other terrain types are not implemented yet
